<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Foundations for Effective</strong>
<strong>Leadership</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Leadership is one of the four functions of management.</strong></li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Leadership relies on the use of position power and personal </strong><strong>power.</strong></li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Leadership traits and styles can influence leadership </strong><strong>effectiveness.</strong></li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fiedler’s contingency model matches leadership styles with </strong><strong>situational differences.</strong></li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>House’s path-goal theory matches leadership styles with task </strong><strong>and follower characteristics.</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leadership traits and styles are a lot like effective manager’s traits and styles. However, managers tend to rely more on position power.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Leadership is one of the four functions of management.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is true that leadership is one of the four functions of management but that does not mean that all managers are effective leaders.</p>

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Types of Power Leaders Use</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>Power</strong>
<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">The ability to get others to do what you want them to do</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reward Power</strong></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>The capacity to offer something of value as a means of influencing other people</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Coercive Power</strong></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>The capacity to punish or withhold positive outcomes as a means of influencing other people.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Legitimate Power</strong></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>The capacity to influence other people by virtue of formal authority or the rights of office.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Expert Power</strong></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>The capacity to influence other people by virtue of specialized knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Referent Power</strong></p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">The capacity to influence other people because of their desire to identify personally with you</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25070" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges.png" alt="" width="310" height="162" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Reward power and Coercive power, the authority to reward and punish, are a part of legitimate power.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Managerial Power = Position Power + Personal Power</strong></p>
&nbsp;

<strong>Power of the POSITION:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Based on things managers can offer to others.</li>
 	<li>Rewards: "If you do what I ask, I'll give you a reward."</li>
 	<li>Coercion: "If you don't do what I ask, I'll punish you."</li>
 	<li>Legitimacy: "Because I am the boss; you must do as I ask."</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Power of the PERSON:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Based on how managers are viewed by others.</li>
 	<li>Expertise—as a source of special knowledge and information.</li>
 	<li>Reference—as a person with whom others like to identify.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Position power should be used sparingly. Personal power, though more difficult to obtain, is more effective in the long term.</em></p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Leadership Styles</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>Leadership Style</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;">o The recurring pattern of behaviors exhibited by a leader:</p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Autocratic Style -- Acts in unilateral command and control fashion</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Human Relation Style -- Emphasizes people over tasks</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Democratic Style -- Encourages participation with an emphasis on both task accomplishments and development of people</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Laissez-faire Style -- Is low on both tasks and people</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A manager that is low on risks and people is unlikely to do much for the organization.</em></p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-25071" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges1-768x503.png" alt="" width="382" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Traits Often Shared by Effective</strong>
<strong>Leaders</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>Drive</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Successful leaders have high energy, display initiative, and are tenacious.</li>

<strong>Self-confidence</strong>

<strong>Flexibility</strong>

 	<li>Successful leaders adapt to fit the needs of followers and the demands of situations.</li>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-25073" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-1.png" alt="" width="198" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Of course, not all effective leaders have all these traits but, then again, the more of these traits a leader has, the more effective he/she is likely to be.</em></p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Fiedler’s Contingency Theory</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

Suggests that the best leadership style depends on the situation

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-25084" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-4-768x413.png" alt="" width="465" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fiedler not only believed but conducted studies to show that effective leadership style is situational. His Task-motivated leader would be similar to the classical/mechanistic style of management while his Relationship-motivated style would be similar to the humanistic/organic management style.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-25085" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-5-768x384.png" alt="" width="500" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fiedler believes that leadership success requires the right style–situation match. He classifies leadership styles as either task-motivated or relationship motivated and views them as strongly rooted in our individual personalities. He describes situations according to the leader’s position power, quality of leader–member relations, and amount of task structure. In situations that are most favorable and unfavorable for leaders, his research shows the task-motivated style as the best fit. In more intermediate situations, the relationship-motivated style provides the best fit.</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>House’s Path-Goal Theory</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Leaders are most effective when they help followers move along paths through which they can achieve both professional and personal goals</em></p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">House’s Four Path-Goal Leadership Styles:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. “<strong>Directive leader</strong>” lets others know what is expected; gives directions, maintains standards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. “<strong>Supportive leader</strong>” makes work more pleasant; treats others as equals, acts friendly, shows concern.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. “<strong>Achievement-oriented leader</strong>” sets challenging goals; expects high performance, shows confidence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. “<strong>Participative leader</strong>” involves others in decision-making; asks for and uses suggestions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each person has different professional and personal needs. An effective leader needs to recognize this and to adjust his style depending on the situation and the individual that he/she is leading.</p>

&nbsp;

<strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-25078" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-2.png" alt="" width="258" height="250" /></strong>

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Just as there are many types of management, there are many types of leaders:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charismatic Leader</strong></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Servant Leadership</strong></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>Means serving others, helping them use their talents to help organizations best serve society.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Empowerment</strong></p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Gives employees job freedom and power to influence affairs in the organization.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Characteristics of a</strong>
<strong>Transformational Leader</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Vision has ideas and a clear sense of direction; communicates them to others; develops excitement about accomplishing shared “dreams.”</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Charisma uses the power of personal reference and emotion to arouse others’ enthusiasm, faith, loyalty, pride, and trust in themselves.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Symbolism identifies “heroes” and holds spontaneous and planned ceremonies to celebrate excellence and high achievement.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Empowerment helps others grow and develop by removing performance obstacles, sharing responsibilities, and delegating truly challenging work.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Intellectual stimulation gains the involvement of others by creating awareness of problems and stirring their imaginations.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Integrity is honest and credible; acts consistently and out of personal conviction; follows through on commitments.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Notice the similarity between effective managers and transformational leaders.</em></p>

<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Peter Drucker</strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>One of the most influential management</strong>
<strong>consultants of the 20th century.</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Peter Drucker’s “Good Old-Fashioned Leadership”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Good leaders have integrity; they mean what they say, earning and keeping the trust of followers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Good leaders define and establish a sense of mission; they set goals, priorities and standards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Good leaders accept leadership as responsibility, not a rank; they surround themselves with talented people.</p>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why Peter Drucker’s leadership advice still matters:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Peter Drucker died at the age of 95 in the year 2005, the former CEO of GE, Jack Welch, said: “The world knows he was the greatest management thinker of the last century." That could be an understatement. Drucker was renowned worldwide for his many books, consultancies, newspaper columns, and sage advice on matters of management, organizations, business and society, and executive leadership.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here is a sample of his enduring advice:</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Management is about human beings.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Do not ever think or say “I.” Think and say “We.”</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Attracting and holding talent have become two of the central tasks of management.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Every decision is risky.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Levels of management should be kept to the minimum.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Effective organizations exist not to satisfy themselves but to fill a customer need.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">I am not going to give you any answers… I am going to give you the questions you should ask.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>These statements cover the essence of what management is supposed to be.</em></p>

<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Effective Communications</strong>
<strong>Defined</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>• “Effective communications” is the faithful reproduction of a thought, idea, observation, instruction, request, greeting, or warning, expressed in a verbal, written, electronic alarm annunciation, or pictorial media, originated by and transmitted by a communicator or communicating device to a specifically targeted receiver or receiver group.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The term “faithful reproduction” means that whatever was contained in the original message that left the communicator is both received by and understood by the targeted receiver or receiver group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The element of understanding the message is the central focus of this definition for, without that element, communications are blocked. Put another way, effective communications simply are nonexistent without a two-way, mutual understanding of the message being communicated.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25133" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-3-min-1.png" alt="" width="542" height="200" />

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Effective Communications</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DUE DILIGENCE BASED ON EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATIONS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Businesses are required by law to establish and maintain what is called “due diligence.” In layman’s terms, that means operating their affairs by paying particular attention to the best welfare and interest of their visitor’s safety and security needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• To meet this “due diligence” requirement, businesses must focus on the foreseeability of real and perceived threats. Next, the law expects businesses to warn people of danger and then avoid or mitigate those threats that have a chance of materializing and causing a substantial loss of assets, damage to property, and/or injury to people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• To comply with this mandate, businesses must conduct perpetual risk analysis, vulnerability assessments, integrated countermeasure designs, security officer training, employee security awareness training, and contingency planning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• However, without “effective” communications none of these practices and procedures could exist. Thus, effective communications are a key element in assisting businesses in meeting their mandate to provide proof of compliance with required levels of due diligence.</p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATIONS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• There are four channels of communications in any organization or company: top-down, bottom-up, horizontal the grapevine. The first three are essential for information to flow in every direction. These are the formal and official forms of communication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The fourth form of communication found in most organizations is the grapevine, which consists of an outgrowth of informal and casual groupings of employees. Effective communications in any security department require all four of these forms. They provide maximum performance both during stable and predictable periods and during times of stress.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25134" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-4-min-1.png" alt="" width="502" height="202" />

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>THE ESSENTIALS OF EFFECTIVE</strong>
<strong>COMMUNICATIONS</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Effective communications must be <strong>timely</strong>, <strong>complete</strong>, <strong>clear</strong>, <strong>concise</strong>, <strong>factual</strong>, and <strong>accurate</strong>. This is a bare-bones list of requirements. Certainly, the complete list includes other attributes, but if these six factors are present, communications will be extremely effective.</p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CONSIDER THE AUDIENCE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Everyone communicates at different levels. If you are communicating with someone who is many levels below your communication level, the message you are sending stands a good chance of being misunderstood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Also, assuming that everyone speaks and understands on your level is almost a guarantee that you will be an ineffective communicator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•The midpoint between talking above your audience and talking below your audience is currently the seventh-grade level. If you want perfect clarity in your communications, then speak slowly, carefully choosing your words, using no more than five-or six-letter words, and choosing words that are commonly known.</p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25135" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-5-min.png" alt="" width="368" height="250" /></p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">•In many cases, when asked to repeat a message, the receiving person uses different words. It is very likely that the receiver’s vocabulary is lacking. Thus, each time you are requested to repeat a message, say it in different words.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•The security officer of the future will almost have to be bilingual. Then there are the medically afflicted people with communication impediments and there may be nothing you can do to breach their difficulties with communicating.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•When dealing with deaf, blind, or MS-afflicted people, patience is your greatest asset, and a strong commitment to helping these people will get you through it. Just be persistent until you can find the way each one communicates.</p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>VERIFY COMMUNICATIONS WITH FEEDBACK</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>• It is of the utmost importance that the receiver of a message gives you some kind of indication that he or she received the message and the message they received is the same one you sent.</strong> What I am alluding to here is the use of feedback to confirm that the receiver did in fact receive the message and understood the message.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>• The initial communicator who sent the message is responsible for assuring that the message was not only received but was the same message that was sent.</strong> The communicator has a right to believe the message was received and understood if a confirmation message is returned. Acceptable confirmation messages would be any of the following: “10-4”, “roger”, “good copy” or a very short verbal message repeating your message.</p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>MYTHS AND MISCONCEPTIONS IN COMMUNICATIONS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>• There is one misconception that causes more errors than any other in the communications field and that is something called brevity, or keeping each and every communication as brief as possible.</strong> In their attempt to accomplish this one goal, the communicator uses abbreviations, personal shorthand, partial words or partial sentences, poor grammar, and a message that requires deciphering.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Being brief many times is not an important goal of writing. Saying as few words as possible and speaking in code is not always the best choice of content for verbal communications. The above list of essentials must be present to have a clear and concise message.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25136" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-6-min.png" alt="" width="444" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The length of the message is important in many situations, such as sending duress codes or using a two-way radio. However, brevity is one of the least important factors and most destructive factors to the attempt to be “effective” with your communications. A much better question to ask, when finished preparing a message is “Does this message have all six essentials of effective communications?” If not, fix it before the message is sent. If that fix extends the message length, it is better to violate the brevity rule than the decipher rule.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Abbreviations are only valuable to the receiver who can decipher them. Shorthand is usually only valuable to the sender of the message and in many cases, cannot be deciphered readily by the receiver of the message. If there is any absolute in effective message sending, it is this:<strong> No message other than a crypto- </strong><strong>message should have to be deciphered by any receiver of the </strong><strong>message.</strong></p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PROPER USE OF COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Telephone Systems</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The telephone is one of the most important tools that any security officer can have at his or her disposal. At the same time, if the telephone equipment is not properly designed for a security or emergency setting, it can be a great problem, hampering effective communications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The telephone equipment in a security program must be simple to use with the least probability of failing during an emergency.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class=" wp-image-25139 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-7-min.png" alt="" width="249" height="175" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">• In modern leading-edge security control centers, there will be a ten-button phone with a caller ID on it for day-to-day business. It will be a part of the facility PBX or electronic phone system, and, like all phones will have the ability to call outside the facility as well as within the facility. It will also be tied into a tape recording device to record all incoming and outgoing calls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Separate and apart from the ten-button phone there will be a red phone used exclusively for emergencies with a caller ID and tape recording device on it as well. This red phone may have a strobe light connected to it to distinguish the ringing sound from all the other phones in the room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• This phone will have no dial-out capability; in fact, the face of the phone will have no dialing keyboard. The reason for having a separate red phone for emergencies is that the security operator or dispatcher will at some point need to communicate over the regular phone lines to call for fire, police, or emergency medical assistance and for other assistance.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class=" wp-image-25138 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-8-min.png" alt="" width="212" height="196" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">• If the emergency phone is tied into the ten-button phone, the emergency event caller at the scene of the emergency must be put on hold while public assistance is being called. Never hang up on the emergency event caller or put the emergency event caller on hold during an actual emergency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The caller under the stress of an emergency may hang up whenever they can’t hear the sounds of your voice or noise in the control center.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• In addition, each security station in the facility should be equipped with a red phone as well as a regular phone. When an emergency call comes in, each red phone should be picked up with the remote stations just listening in to the conversation between the dispatcher and emergency event caller.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Then, before hanging up, each station will confirm that they have received the message heard over the red phone. The emergency telephone system is not a place to skimp on cost or design when so much depends on effective communications during emergencies. In fact, just in case you lose your connection with the emergency event caller, it is best to jot down that person’s name and phone number immediately at the outset of the call.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class=" wp-image-25137 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-9-min.png" alt="" width="271" height="201" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">• A third phone, a yellow phone, would be a single analog line separate and apart from the facility PBX or electronic telephone system. This phone will have a hardwired four lead telephone cable inside of a conduit from the wall jack in the room where the phone is located to the street level mainframe. The conduit will lessen the threat of the line being cut or burned through during an emergency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• This line will tie directly to the mainframe of the local telephone office and it will operate on its own power. Therefore, this direct tie to the outside world will be somewhat protected from numerous threats. The conduit-encased phone line would almost assure an outside line during any power outage or computer failure that could cripple the facility’s PBX or electronic telephone system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The fourth phone in some facilities, a black phone, is physically identical to the red phone. It cannot be dialed. This phone is dedicated to panic alarm annunciation. If there is a threat on executive row, or a robbery in the credit union, certain designated employees are trained to use the black phone for “duress code” messages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The cell phone is the newest addition to the phone systems available for security officers. In many locations, security departments are investing in cell phones that double as two-way radios. At this point, for most security departments, these telephones- radio combination units are too costly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• In other locations, cell phones are used as backup units to the two-way radios for communications where two-way radio signals are blocked by dead spots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Cell phones play an important part during patrol duties to allow emergency calls to be made from the scene, back to the control center when the two-way radio is ineffective. The cell phone can also be used for calls directly to the 911 emergency response centers.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class=" wp-image-25142 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-10-min.png" alt="" width="200" height="200" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Two-Way Radios</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The two-way radio is the primary mobile communications device that almost all security officers use to communicate with the control center and between other officers, supervisors and management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• There are some problems with most two-way radio systems and that trouble includes, but is not limited to, failure to operate in dead spots, being susceptible to operator error, and having short battery life. In addition, an adequate two-way radio system is expensive; the units are bulky and take up space on a crowded utility belt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Some of these radios break down regularly and are costly to maintain. But all of these shortcomings aside, we could not do the security job as well as we do without effective communications devices like the two-way radios.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Two-way radios are miniature radio stations and as such something called “ground-wave propagation” makes the difference between effective communications and either broken communications with static or no communications at all.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="wp-image-25143 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-11-min.png" alt="" width="80" height="222" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Ground-wave propagations are the scientific explanation that explains how a radio signal travels from the source antenna to the receiving antenna. It also explains that if anywhere along that path, there is an object that is so well grounded, like an I-beam or other metal object, the signal will be short-circuited and driven into the ground before the message reaches the receiver’s antenna. Because the transmission antenna sends out many pear-shaped signals, not just one, to overcome this signal interference problem, the officer needs only to walk a few feet from where the transmission is garbled and the signal may be reestablished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The two-way radio is most effective, with the antenna 90 degrees perpendicular to the ground. The antenna should be pointing straight up in the air during use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-25144 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-12-min.png" alt="" width="420" height="223" /></p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">• By tipping the antenna sideways or horizontal to the ground, the unit becomes somewhat directional and the strongest transmission will be along the line where the antenna is pointing. If a two-way radio antenna is pointing away from the receiving antenna, then the radio is being used in a very ineffective manner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• In many systems, signal strength gets a boost by use of a repeater. A repeater is a great help but it brings with it one major problem. The way it works makes it somewhat user-unfriendly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The repeater receives the signal, turns it around, and sends it back out as a more powerful signal. That process takes time. Thus, the two-way radio communicator must hold the transmission switch down for two seconds before talking to engage the repeater and then the communicator must hold the switch down for two seconds after the message is finished to allow for processing. If this is not done, your message will be clipped at both ends. Then there is the way one should talk into the transceiver. When holding the transceiver up to talk, hold it to the side of your mouth and speak across the microphone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Do not speak directly into the microphone or you may speak too loudly and cause distortion of the transmitted message.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The frequency of the radio also has an impact on effective communications. Most radios used by security are FM transceivers. They are either VHF or UHF. Two-way radios that are called VHF transceivers, work on what is known as very high frequency. The UHF radios operate on ultra-high frequency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Science explains the differences between these two transmission levels. The lower the frequency, the longer the wavelength. That means the VHF signal will travel a long way, but a VHF signal is a relatively weak signal and does not work as well in tall buildings with lots of steel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The UHF transceiver on the other hand is a stronger signal but has a much shorter wavelength. That means it packs a wallop and works well in tall buildings with lots of steel, but it can’t travel too far. A UHF system with a repeater in line is possibly the most effective two-way radio communications system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pagers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The pager takes a telephone call to respond to unless it is a voice pager or a text pager that displays messages. Pagers are nice because they are small and work just about everywhere. However, they do not allow the message receiver to respond with a message and they do not allow for verification that the signal was received and understood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Pagers should be used for backup only. Two-way radios and cell phones are the best communications devices for portable operations.</p>

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Intercoms</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• In a retail setting or a hospital setting emergency, codes are sent over the intercom. We all know that “code blue” means cardiovascular problems complicated by respiratory failure. We know that “code red” means fire. In some retail companies, a call over the intercom such as “Mr. Jones, please come to the front of the store” means that security is needed at the front of the store. The intercom is useful when it is working, but traditionally the intercom system is a weak link in the communications systems of any facility.</p>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">• There are problems with volume and static, and they seem to have more than their fair share of maintenance needs. If the intended receiver of the message is out of the area where there are no speakers, the message will not be received. In addition, there usually are no procedures to inform the communicator that the message was received and understood. However, we still need the intercom and it is advised that we fix it as soon as it breaks down. Extra speakers should be placed in remote and hard-to-hear-in areas all over the facility to assure emergency messages reach everyone. If you work in a facility and you even think that a message might have been transmitted over an intercom, call dispatch and check out your suspicion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The greatest mistake that a communicator can make using the intercom is to speak too loud into the microphone. Many systems will distort if the input signal exceeds maximum input voltage. You do not have to speak loud when announcing over an intercom. They all have an amplifier in them that takes care of sound level.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>13 Public Speaking</strong>
<strong>Mistakes You Don't Want to Make</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Jacquelyn Smith, Business Insider, February 4, 2016</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Gloss Phobia</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fear of public speaking — is one of the most common phobias among Americans today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the National Institute of Mental Health, a whopping 74% of people suffer from speech anxiety.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And, as most people know, when we're nervous or anxious, our minds and bodies tend to do weird things that we can't always control.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, if you make a conscious effort, you may be able to avoid some of the common mistakes public speakers make.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some habits you'll want to avoid, along with their potential consequences and suggested remedies:</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Not Tailoring Your Message to</strong>
<strong>Your Audience</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Benjamin Disraeli once said, "Talk to a man about himself and he will listen for hours."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, if you don't talk to your audience about themselves, they most likely won't listen, says Darlene Price, president of Well Said, Inc. and author of "Well Said! Presentations and Conversations That Get Results." "Speakers frequently fall into the bad habit of giving generic off-the-shelf presentations that are not tailored to address the needs of this particular audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Listeners know when the speaker has not done their homework, and their response ranges from disappointment and frustration to anger and disengaging."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To avoid this, ask yourself: Who is my audience? What are their burning issues? How does my message help them? How much do they know about my topic? What will I ask them to do in response to my message? "All the best practices in public speaking depend upon this first tenet: Know Your Audience."</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25152" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-19-min.png" alt="" width="149" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Eye Dart</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">From beginners to veterans, the majority of speakers fail to maintain meaningful, sustained eye contact with their listeners. "Unconsciously, their eyes scurry from person to person, darting around the room, without ever pausing to actually see the recipients of their message," Price says. "A lack of eye contact implies a list of offenses: insincerity, disinterest, detachment, insecurity, shiftiness, and even arrogance."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To visually connect, maintain eye contact for at least two to three seconds per person, or long enough to complete a full phrase or sentence. Effective eye communication is the most important nonverbal skill in a speaker's toolbox.</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Distracting Mannerisms</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are at least 20 common tics to tackle, including clenching or wringing your hands, pacing back and forth, keeping your hands in pockets, jingling change or keys, twisting your ring, gripping the lectern, licking your lips, adjusting your hair or clothing, fidgeting with a pen, bobbing your head, placing your arms behind your back, and touching your face. "One or more of these habits can distract the audience from your message and jeopardize your credibility," Price explains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a remedy, record yourself speaking and watch the playback. "Practice often to increase your comfort level and reduce anxiety. Take a public speaking class or enlist the help of a local coach to eliminate distracting mannerisms and habituate purposeful movement."</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25153" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-20-min.png" alt="" width="124" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Low Energy</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">"As the Guinness World Record holder for the most performances in the same Broadway show, George Lee Andrews is famous for playing the role of Monsieur Andre in The Phantom of the Opera," Price says. "Surely, he must have felt tired during at least one or two of his 9,382 performances, but he didn't show it considering his contract was renewed 45 times over 23 years."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enthusiasm, defined as eager enjoyment and active interest, is an audience's most desired trait in a presenter. Conversely, a boring delivery — evidenced by a low monotone voice, dull facial expressions, and overall lethargy — is their most disliked trait. "To avoid losing your audience in a New York minute, crank up the energy level," says Price. "Speak expressively, smile sincerely, move naturally, and enjoy the moment."</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Not Rehearsing</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most proficient presenters prepare. "That is, they know the topic, organize their content, design a slide deck, and study their notes," Price says. However, according to a recent survey she conducted, less than 2% of over 5,000 business presenters in Fortune 100 companies actually conduct a dress rehearsal and practice their presentation aloud. This bad habit results in the audience seeing and hearing the unrefined run-through, versus the finessed final performance. "To optimize their perception of you and get the outcome you want, perform the entire presentation aloud at least once, and the opening and closing at least three times," she suggests.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25154" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-21-min.png" alt="" width="208" height="226" />

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Data Dumping</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It's understandable. After all, our credibility is on the line when we stand up and speak out," Price says. "So, to be safe, we focus almost entirely on what Aristotle called Logos, which includes the left-brain functions of logic, language, analysis, reasoning, critical thinking, and numbers."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we rely too heavily on this type of content, we end up talking too long, reading too many over-crowded illegible slides, and turning our backs on the most important element of all: the audience. "Ditch the habit of data dumping," she suggests. "It loses the audience and undermines your innate ability to inspire, connect, and persuade."</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Not Inspiring</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even more vital to persuasion than Logos, says Aristotle, is Pathos, which includes the right-brain activities of emotions, images, stories, examples, empathy, humor, imagination, color, sounds, touch, and rapport, Price says.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Tomes of studies show human beings typically make decisions based on emotions first (Pathos); then, we look for the facts and figures to justify it (Logos). Audience members do the same. With your words, actions, and visuals, seek first to inspire an emotion in them (joy, surprise, hope, excitement, love, empathy, vulnerability, sadness, fear, envy, guilt). Then, deliver the analysis to justify the emotion."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An engaging, memorable, and persuasive presentation is balanced with both information and inspiration. "It speaks to the head and the heart, leveraging both facts and feelings," she says.</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Lack of Pauses</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many speakers have the bad habit of rushing through their content. Like a runaway train, they speed down the track out of control, unable to stop and turn at critical junctures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The causes are often anxiety, adrenaline, or time constraints, Price says. "Regardless of the reason, the three times you definitely want to pause include: before and after you say something very important which you want your audience to remember; before and after you transition from one key talking point to the next; and between your opening, main body, and closing."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you consciously use silence as a rhetorical device, you'll come across as more self-confident, your message will be more impactful, and your audience will remember more of what you say.</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Not Crafting a Powerful Opening</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">"According to Plato, 'the beginning is the most important part of the work.' Yet, it's a common bad habit for speakers to waste those precious opening seconds rambling pointlessly, telling a joke, reading an agenda, or apologizing needlessly, all of which fail to grab the audience's attention and motivate them to listen," Price says.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You, your message, and your audience deserve much more. So, open with a bang. Invest the thought, time and effort to craft and memorize "the most important part of the work." For example, tell an engaging, relevant story; state a startling statistic; or ask a thought-provoking question.</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Using Too Much (or Not Enough)</strong>
<strong>Humor</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">It's hard to determine exactly how much humor to use in a speech — especially if you don't know your audience well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, you don't want your presentation to be dry and boring, but you also don't want to come off like you're trying too hard to be a stand-up comedian.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A good rule of thumb is to be yourself, and infuse a bit of humor when appropriate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting the audience to laugh (or at least crack a smile) early on is a great way to break the ice. But run your joke(s) but some friends beforehand to make sure they don't fall flat.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25155" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-22-min.png" alt="" width="151" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Reading from Your Slides</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">A slideshow can be very helpful for jogging your memory and reinforcing the main points of the presentation to your audience. However, as Inc. contributing editor Geoffrey James points out, the people watching your presentation can read, so giving them the exact same information verbally and visually can be boring and insulting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Use slides as visual signposts for the points you're making rather than a written version or summary of those points," James writes for Inc.</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Making an Excuse or an</strong>
<strong>Apology</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps you're running late and want to let your audience know why. Or maybe you just stepped off a long flight and want to explain why your performance might not be as strong as it would otherwise. Either way, making an excuse or an apology sets a negative tone and gives people a reason to think your presentation was underwhelming. Instead, take any personal mishaps in stride and let the audience evaluate your performance independently. "Regardless of how you're feeling, show enthusiasm for being there and make your best effort," James writes.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25156" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-23-min.png" alt="" width="159" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Ending with Q&amp;A</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">There's a good chance you've heard a speaker end an otherwise effective presentation with an abrupt, 'That's it. Any questions?' "For the audience, it's like a firework with a wet fuse, otherwise known as a 'dud,'" Price says. "Your grand finale is your last chance to reinforce your key points, ensure the memorability of your message, and motivate the audience to action. Avoid the bad habit of closing on Q&amp;A, which risks ending your presentation on a non-climatic down-in-the-weeds topic."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It's fine to invite the audience's comments and questions; however, be sure to end strong. "Craft an effective three-part closing where you deliver a strong summary; present a call-to-action, and conclude with a powerful closing statement. Develop the habit of saying last what you want your audience to remember most," she concludes.</p>

•Activities or games can facilitate this process

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Activity #1</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>Unique Introductions</strong>

1. Get into pairs (Not necessarily with your best friend)

2. Talk for three minutes and share at least one thing with your colleague that they did not know

3. Introduce your colleague and tell their secret

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25166" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-min-3.png" alt="" width="348" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Activity #2</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>Commonalities</strong>

1. Divide the group in half

2. Find one thing the group has in common—Three minutes—then share

3. Divide the group in half and find another commonality related to the first

4. Divide again and find another commonality related to the second

5. So on and so forth…

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>When Groups Form Teams</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

•Roles and interactions are not established.

•Some members may observe as they attempt to determine what’s expected of them.

•Others engage the team process immediately.

•As members learn their roles, they find ways to work together and learn about team issues.

•These processes occur in four stages.

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Stage 1 –Forming</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Period in which members are often guarded in their interactions because they’re not sure what to expect from other team members.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•This is also the period in which members form opinions of their teammates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•During this stage, productivity is low.</p>
&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Forming – Enhance Team Development by:</span>

•Share responsibility

•Encourage open dialogue

•Provide structure

•Direct team issues

•Develop a climate of trust and respect.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25167" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-1-min-3.png" alt="" width="583" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Stage 2 -Storming</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Characterized by competition and strained relationships among team members. There are various degrees of conflict dealing with issues of power, leadership and decision-making.</p>
•This is the most critical stage for the team.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-25168" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-3-min-3.png" alt="" width="400" height="200" />

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Storming -Enhance Team Development by:</span>

•Joint problem-solving.

•Norms for different points of view.

•Decision-making procedures.

•Encourage two-way communication.

•Support collaborative team efforts.

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Stage 3 -Norming</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Characterized by cohesiveness among members. In this phase, members realize their commonalities and learn to appreciate their differences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Functional relationships are developed resulting in the evolution of trust among members.</p>
&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Norming -Enhance Team Development by:</span>

•Communicate frequently and openly about concerns.

•Encourage members to manage the team process.

•Give positive and constructive feedback.

•Support consensus decision-making efforts.

•Delegate to team members as much as possible.

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Stage 4 -Performing</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">•The team now possesses the capability to define tasks, work through relationships, and manage team conflicts by themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Communication is open and supportive. Members interact without fear of rejection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Leadership is participative and shared. Different viewpoints and information is shared openly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Conflict is now viewed as a catalyst that generates creativity in the problem-solving process.</p>
&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Performing -Enhance Team Development by:</span>

•Offer feedback when requested.

•Support new ideas and ways for achieving outcomes.

•Encourage ongoing self-assessment.

•Develop team members to their fullest potential.

•Look for ways to increase the team’s capacity.

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>REMEMBER!!!</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Any change in the composition of the team or its</em>
<em>leadership will return the team to the forming stage.</em></p>

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Team Process</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The most effective teams arrive at decisions through consensus by following a rational process that includes:</span></p>
•Identifying the issue.

•Setting a specific objective.

•Gathering and analyzing the facts.

•Developing alternatives.

•Evaluating the alternatives.

•Deciding and acting.

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the problem-solving process, teams must also engage in interpersonal interaction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Decisions are made and objectives are achieved by not only effectively following the problem-solving process, but also to the extent that team members share information in an open, candid, honest, and trustful manner.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Becoming a Leader</strong>
<strong>What is Leadership?</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁ Leadership is the ability to inspire others to make a total and willing commitment to accomplishing or exceeding the organization’s goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Elements:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁ <strong>Inspiring others</strong> – it represents a higher-level concept than “motivating”. Inspiration is longer lasting.</p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>We inspire people by exemplifying personal and professional characteristics they admire and would like to have themselves.</li>
 	<li>People are inspired by us when they observe traits and behaviors that make them want to be like us.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁ <strong>Total, willing, and voluntary commitment</strong> – makes it is easier to lead people:</p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">When they want to go where you are leading</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">When the organization’s goals become their goals</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">When it is just as important to them as it is to us that the goals are accomplished</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">This, in the end, becomes a WIN, WIN situation</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>How You Can Become an</strong>
<strong>Effective Leader</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Learn Your Organization’s Vision and Commit to Helping Achieve It.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>As you advance in your career you will increasingly face responsibilities, </em><em>obstacles, challenges, and problems that are new to you. A can-do </em><em>attitude will give you the inner strength needed to face the unknown and </em><em>conquer it.</em></p>

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁ Be an Effective Conflict Manager and Consensus Builder</p>

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>New Leader Traps</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not learning quickly</span> -Not using the time before entry effectively can undermine one's ability to learn and to get on top of the job right away. The time prior to entry is a priceless period when the new leader can go beyond merely absorbing information about the organization to create a joining-up strategy for a successful transition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Isolation</span> -It's easy for new leaders to isolate themselves from important relationships and sources of information about what is really going on. As one leader said: "There can be a tendency to say, ‘Well, I'll lock myself in the room and I'll come up with a plan.' That is important, but you're not going to lay the groundwork to be able to speak and execute with authority until people feel like they know you."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Know-it all</span> -New leaders who show up with a single answer for complex organizational problems usually do so out of arrogance or insecurity, or because they believe they must appear decisive and establish a directive tone. Employees may hesitate to share information if they believe the new leader's mind is already made up. Typically, the result is less support for change.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25182" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-7-1.png" alt="" width="175" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Keeping existing team</span> -Many new leaders believe subordinates they inherit deserve a chance to prove themselves. For some, this is a matter of fairness; others are motivated by arrogance ("I can make these people") or hubris ("All it takes is hard work, support, and leadership"). Whatever the rationale, retaining managers with a history of mediocre performance can damage the new leader's credibility and almost always slows the pace of change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taking on too much</span> -It is important for the new leader to experiment to discover what works and what doesn't. But too much experimentation can deprive promise change initiatives of resources or the attention they need to reach fruition. Poor prioritizing and inadequate up-front planning can make a leader susceptible to being diverted by peripheral issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Captured by wrong people</span> -Those who have exerted influence in the old regime will inevitably jockey for position in the new. It is all too easy for the new leader to waste precious time on people who cannot help because they are incapable or outdated, or even wish to mislead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Successor syndrome</span> -At greatest risk is the new leader hired as second-in-command with the expectation that success will lead to promotion to the top position. In the absence of a solid working relationship, the CEO may feel threatened by the new leader's changes and resist letting go of the reins of power.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Finding ways so both parties interests are optimized</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<strong>For example</strong>, both parties benefit when negotiators find that a change in buyer requirements will enable the seller to deliver a higher-quality standard product instead of a specially built product. The seller realizes lower risks or perhaps more profit from the sale of a standard product. The buyer pays a lower price for a product that meets the buyer's real needs.</p>

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Negotiation Skills Required</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Negotiation is a process of communication by which two parties, each with its own viewpoint and objectives, attempt to reach a mutually satisfactory result on a matter of common concern.</p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>In a negotiation, a mutually satisfactory result is vital, because even though the parties may have opposing interests they also are dependent on each other. <strong>For example</strong>: Labor and management, need each other to produce products efficiently and effectively. Likewise, buyers and sellers need each other to transact business. Both sides must be willing to live with the result.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25186" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-1-3.png" alt="" width="118" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Listening required</span> -Not one party dictating or imposing terms on another. When that happens, the outcome will rarely produce mutual satisfaction. The result can only be mutually satisfactory if both differences and common interests are considered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Preparation required</span> -To obtain agreement, you must generally sacrifice or yield something in order to get something in return</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Execution required</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Communication</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-25187" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-2-4.png" alt="" width="209" height="302" />

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Communication is More than</strong>
<strong>Verbal</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Good negotiators must first be good communicators.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Verbal exchanges account for only a fraction of the messages people send and receive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁70 -90 percent of the entire communication spectrum is nonverbal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Nonverbal communication is all forms of communication that are not part of the language that we speak or write.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Although we continually send and receive nonverbal messages, most of us are not fully aware of the ways that we communicate nonverbally. Still, if you watch carefully, you will see that most leading professionals are excellent nonverbal communicators.</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Areas of Nonverbal</strong>
<strong>Communication</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<img class="wp-image-25188 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-3-min-5.png" alt="" width="172" height="201" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁There are many ways that we reveal ourselves nonverbally. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There are three areas of nonverbal communication that will most likely affect contract negotiations:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Body language -using facial expressions, body movements, gestures, and posture</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Physical environment</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Personal attributes such as:</p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Physical appearance</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Vocal cues</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Touch particularly the handshake</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Cultural Differences</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Always consider cultural differences when you send or receive nonverbal messages. <strong>A message that has a particular meaning in one society can have a completely different meaning in another society.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<strong>For example:</strong> in the United States, we encourage eye contact as an indicator of honesty and interest. People in some other societies believe that they should look down when talking to another person to indicate deference and respect. For them, direct eye contact might be considered offensive and disrespectful.</p>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">-This illustration depicts the body language demonstrated by two negotiation teams</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-The nonverbal messages provide substantial information about both teams</p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">The team on the right transmits nonverbal messages exuding confidence and success</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Left transmits nonverbal messages that convey negative attitudes (folded arms across chest, checking watch, lack of attention)</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Winning Attitude?</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

⦁Positive attitudes signal a sincere effort
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Speakers show respect and honesty by keeping their eyes focused on the eyes of the listeners</p>
⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Confidence is often exhibited by:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>Hands in pockets with thumbs out</li>
 	<li>Hands on the lapel of the coat</li>
 	<li>Steepled fingers or hands</li>
 	<li>Good body posture</li>

<ul>
 	<li>Rubbing hands together</li>
 	<li>Smiling excessively</li>
 	<li>Frequent nodding of the head</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Negative Attitudes</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Negative attitudes indicated by body language may signal a deceitful nature or a win/lose approach to negotiation. Common indicators of negative attitudes are listed below.</p>
•<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deception or dishonesty is demonstrated by:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>Frequent eye blinking</li>
 	<li>Hand covering mouth while speaking</li>

<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>The Effects of the Physical</strong>
<strong>Environment on Negotiations</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">The physical environment transmits nonverbal messages that can extremely important to negotiators.</p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key elements of the environment:</span>

•Negotiation facility

•Conference table configuration, size, and seating arrangements

•Physical distance between negotiators

•Relative elevation of the negotiators
<p style="text-align: left;">•Visual aids</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Negotiation Table Configuration</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25196" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-min-4.png" alt="" width="347" height="250" />

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Table arrangement transmits important conscious and subliminal messages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Winning negotiation attitudes can be promoted with table configurations that convey trust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Win/lose attitudes are created by table settings that communicate disparity or mistrust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Table should be large enough to comfortably seat all participants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Ideal place for a principal negotiator is the middle seat. Central position conveys a message of authority.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-25246" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-7-3.png" alt="" width="223" height="275" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">• <strong>Arrangement A</strong> is a typical configuration for contract negotiations. The two parties sit together to indicate and foster unity. Each team is on a different side of the table and the teams are facing each other so each team member can clearly hear what anyone on the other team must say.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•<strong>Arrangement B</strong> may tend to give one party an advantage over the other because the arrangement suggests only one important person, the person at the end of the vertical extension.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•<strong>Arrangement C</strong> shows a need for space between the two parties. That space could mean more formality or less trust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•<strong>Arrangement D</strong> may be the most conducive to win/win negotiations because the round shape is usually associated with equality.</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Physical Distance between</strong>
<strong>Negotiators</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">People in different cultures require different amounts of physical distance for communication. Too little or too much space between people can have a negative effect. In the United States, most people:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<strong>Distance closer than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1.5</span> feet -intimate communication</strong></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>A negotiator may be annoyed and nervous if you attempt to conduct any significant communication from any distance closer than 1.5 feet.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<strong>Distance of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1.5</span> to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.0</span> feet -close interpersonal contact</strong></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>A negotiator will likely become increasingly annoyed and nervous as you move closer.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<strong>Distance of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.0</span> to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">12.0</span> feet -most business transactions or consultations</strong></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>Note that four feet is about the distance across the typical conference table.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<strong>Distance beyond <span style="text-decoration: underline;">12.0</span> feet -Communicate only briefly or formally</strong></p>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Personal Attributes and</strong>
<strong>Negotiations</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">•<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attractive people are perceived to:</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>Have more self-esteem and social power</li>
 	<li>Receive preferential treatment in the initiation and development of interpersonal relationships</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Height affects perceptions:</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>Taller people are perceived as more dominant</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Body type affects perceptions:</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Athletic people are more assertive and self-reliant.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Less athletic-looking people can be perceived as more lazy, sympathetic, and dependent.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Skinny fragile-looking people can be perceived as more suspicious, nervous, and pessimistic.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25195" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-11-1.png" alt="" width="97" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Physical Appearance</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, many otherwise good negotiators ignore the importance of personal dress during negotiations, and that ignorance negatively affects their ability to attain mutually satisfactory negotiation results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dress for negotiations as you would for a promotion or job interview</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>Casual days are growing in popularity. On such days, more casual dress may be appropriate. <strong>Advise contractor of your intent to adopt a more casual atmosphere.</strong></li>
 	<li>Remember that more casual dress will reduce the nonverbal emphasis on your credibility and professionalism.</li>
 	<li>Clothing, such as jeans, is never appropriate unless you are negotiating on a construction site or similar area.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">If wearing a uniform, wear it properly.</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>In general, people in uniform are perceived to have more power.</li>
 	<li>Failing to wear a uniform properly may be perceived as showing disrespect for yourself, your organization, and the other negotiator.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal grooming</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Can communicate unfavorable nonverbal messages about you or your negotiation position</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Remember, that if you look good, you will generally: Feel better, perform better, and be perceived better by others</em></p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25200" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-2-5.png" alt="" width="144" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Vocal Cues</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Without enough <strong>loudness</strong>, you cannot be heard. However, shouting or a harsh-sounding voice may be perceived as disruptive or insulting. Many times, lowering your voice almost to a whisper will help you make a point better than shouting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Most factual communication includes moderate <strong>changes in the pitch</strong> of your voice. A monotone involves little or no change and may be perceived as indicating apathy or boredom. A high-pitched voice may be perceived as indicating excitement. A low-pitched voice may be perceived as indicating anger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁A slow <strong>rate of speech</strong> may frustrate the listener. An increasing rate may be perceived as the result of increasing intensity. A fast rate may be perceived as an indicator of nervousness and it may also be difficult to understand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<strong>Quality</strong> is the characteristic that permits you to differentiate one voice from another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁The regular or <strong>rhythmic voice pattern</strong> will normally make you sound more confident or authoritative. Irregular speech might be perceived as more thoughtful or uncertain depending on your words and other nonverbal messages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<strong>Speaking each word clearly</strong> makes you easier to understand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁To be understood, you must also use the <strong>correct sounds and </strong><strong>emphasis</strong> in pronouncing each word. Mispronouncing a word might be perceived as an indicator of ignorance or incompetence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁The absence of sound can also send a strong message. <strong>Silence</strong> gives you an opportunity to listen. You can obtain useful information from the contractor's team by listening to what they say and how they say it.</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Handshake Cues</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use your initial handshake to convey a positive first impression:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<strong>Firm</strong> -conveys positive attributes</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<strong>Loose</strong> -may send unflattering messages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<strong>Vice-like grip</strong> -rarely sends a positive message, it can be perceived as an attempt at imitation</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Smile and look the person in the eye to signal honesty and friendliness</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Use a handshake after an agreement to symbolically seal the agreement and set the stage for a positive continuing relationship.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25201" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-3-min-6.png" alt="" width="362" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Emphasize the warmth and importance of your continued relationship by:</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Briefly <strong>prolonging the handshake</strong></li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Grasping the person's hand between both your hands</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Use a smile and positive words to dispel any tensions</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Failing to offer a handshake could seriously damage any hope for a positive continuing relationship</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Preparation</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-25202" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-4-1.png" alt="" width="190" height="250" />

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Negotiator's Preparation</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Many negotiators do not understand the importance of preparation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Preparation is everything from conducting market research to conducting exchanges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Poor preparation leads to poor contracts that require constant clarification, modification, and more negotiation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Use 90% of your time in preparation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Detailed preparation produces substantial rewards, including:</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Fewer contract modifications</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Better technical performance</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Cost estimates closer to actual costs</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Be Prepared</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Successful negotiators are generally the best prepared</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁No amount of negotiator experience, skill, or persuasive ability can fully compensate for the absence of preparation</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Other bargaining rules cannot be entirely effective without preparation</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25203" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-5-min-3.png" alt="" width="587" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Preparation Dividends</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Adequate preparation includes a careful study of the strengths and weaknesses of both positions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁No other aspect of negotiation continually pays better returns than preparing for the upcoming bargaining session.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Conversely, poor preparation adversely affects your chances of success.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Since there is just no substitute for good preparation, you should never negotiate an issue unless you are adequately prepared.</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Contract Risks</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

⦁Every contract involves risks.

⦁One negotiator may gain power by reducing the risk exposure perceived by the other party.

⦁It can be reduced or controlled but cannot be eliminated completely.

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Issues</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

⦁Issues are the basis for the differences between negotiation positions.

⦁Identify the key issues before you develop your objectives.

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Negotiation Priorities</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<strong>Prioritize Issues</strong> -Rank potential negotiation issues in relative order of importance</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Determine whether each issue is a:</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Must point -Nonnegotiable issues</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Give point -Issues open to concession</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Avoid point -Issues to avoid during negotiations</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Bargaining point -Issues open to bargaining</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Cost or Price Objectives</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Technical, rates and factors issues will eventually affect cost and price objectives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Without an overall price objective, negotiations can result in settlements that can’t be explained or defended.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Negotiating cost element by cost element can be risky unless you understand the effect of these agreements on the overall price.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Price objectives should be planned in terms of a definite dollar amount.</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Contractor Approach to</strong>
<strong>Negotiation</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Questions to consider:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁What objectives and priorities has the contractor probably established?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁How will the contractor's general business objectives and priorities affect the negotiation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁How will the individual objectives and priorities of the contractor's negotiator affect negotiations?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁What negotiation styles and tactics will the contractor's negotiator likely use?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁What pressures and constraints will affect the contractor's approach to negotiations?</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Aim High</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁The slogan "aim high" has a great deal of relevance for successful negotiators because the expectation level of negotiators is closely related to the outcome of the negotiations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Expectations are the gauges by which people measure their performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Generally, the higher your expectations, the better you will ultimately perform.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Expectations influence behavior which influences the outcome of the bargaining session.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁You have a better chance at success if you think you will do well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Sellers who expect to receive more for their product generally receive a higher price.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Pressures and limitations affect expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Develop positive assumptions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Have high expectations on price and non-price issues:</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>Quality</li>
 	<li>Timely delivery</li>
 	<li>Long term relationship</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Negotiating a price that is not fair and reasonable will likely result in a win/lose or lose/lose outcome.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25208" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-10-min-1.png" alt="" width="366" height="200" />

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Leave Room to Compromise</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Choose opening that allows compromise</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁State initial position below the expected price</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Contractors normally ask for more than what they expect</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Based on one objective, the contractor will never fully understand your compromises Contractor expects a compromise</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁When you fail to offer a compromise, the negotiator's expectations are lowered</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Never establish an unreasonable position just to give yourself room to compromise</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Opening position should be your minimum position</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Pressure the Contractor</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Believe that there are unknown pressures</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Identify specific pressure elements</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Refer to potential alternatives:</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>Canceling and re-soliciting</li>
 	<li>Changing product requirements</li>
 	<li>Changing terms and conditions</li>
 	<li>Investing in new source development</li>
 	<li>Using in-house resources</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25210" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-11-min-1.png" alt="" width="174" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Do not let artificial pressures increase the negotiating pressure</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁If the contractor's negotiator is a company vice-president, it should not be any more stressful than if you were negotiating with any other salesman</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Do not allow certifications adorning walls or business cards to intimidate you</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Execution</strong></h2>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Do Not Volunteer Weaknesses</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Never volunteer information that would weaken your position.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Respond to questions without telling falsehoods or volunteering information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Carefully word statements or, if needed, avoid a direct response to a direct question.</p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For example</strong></span> -let’s say your car eats a lot of gas. With rising gas prices, you want to get rid of it so you decide to sell it. A commonly asked question from buyers is, "Why are you selling your car?“. How can you answer this question without telling a falsehood?</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Possible Response:</strong></span> A seller not wanting to disclose the poor gas mileage could avoid revealing the weakness and still be honest by saying "I want to get another car" or "I just want to drive something different" or "I just want to sell my car“.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Use Concessions Wisely</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because compromise is a vital part of contract negotiations, most successful negotiators are masters of when and how to make concessions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Do not appear overly generous or rush to make concessions</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Concede slowly and in small amounts</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Concessions too large or given too quickly may:</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>Unnecessarily raise expectations</li>
 	<li>Give the impression that the concessions were not that important</li>
 	<li>Leave little room for further maneuvering</li>
 	<li>Be more than necessary to achieve a mutually satisfactory result</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Link concessions with the spirit of compromise</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Never make a concession without getting, or asking for, a concession</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25216" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-min-6.png" alt="" width="254" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Problems with demands for equal concessions</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>Only equal if both are equally far from their objective</li>
 	<li>Once you get away from the issues, it may be impossible to return</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Splitting the difference is a form of the equal-concession trap</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>Most often offered in price negotiations</li>
 	<li>No guarantee that the price will be fair and reasonable</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Avoid repetitive splitting the difference</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Say it Right</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">The time-worn axiom, "it's not what you say but how you say it," aptly applies to the way successful negotiators communicate with other negotiators.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25212" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-3-min-7.png" alt="" width="265" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sell yourself and your ideas</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>Show politeness and cordiality</li>
 	<li>Think before you speak</li>
 	<li>Anticipate negative reactions</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Never use provocative terms</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li><em>For example</em>, use "resolute" instead of "stubborn" or "incorrect" rather than "stupid."</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Negotiate from strength</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Do not use a first name or nickname if that the person might be offended</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Keep it simple -Negotiators generally will be less willing to agree when they do not understand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Never personalize differences</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Project strength and confidence</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25217" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-2-6.png" alt="" width="153" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do not:</span></strong></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>Sound insincere, tentative, or overly eager</li>
 	<li>Chance slighting the other negotiator</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Be cautious about expressing unrelated opinions</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Be calm</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Penalty for not saying it right</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>Irrevocable harm to the process</li>
 	<li>Might set an adversarial tone</li>
 	<li>The offended negotiator might resist every offer</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Satisfy Non-Price Issues</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Most negotiations will not end in agreement unless the price &amp; non-price issues are satisfied.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Successful negotiators can identify non-price needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Common non-price issues:</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Technical requirements</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Data requirements</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Contract start</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Contract type</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Contract financing</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Delivery</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Options</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Furnished property</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Use the Power of Patience</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">•<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use patience to:</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>Increase the stress of contractor</li>
 	<li>Display resolve or firmness</li>
 	<li>Dissipate emotional feelings</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Extra time may translate into thousands or even millions of dollars in concessions</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•The best deal for both sides takes time</p>
<img class="size-full wp-image-25213 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-4-min-4.png" alt="" width="219" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Be Willing to Walk Away from or</strong>
<strong>Back to Negotiations</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Deadlock cannot always be avoided and is sometimes necessary when dealing with unfair or unreasonable parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Good negotiators are neither afraid to walk away nor too proud to return.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Willingness to deadlock when a fair deal cannot be obtained is important.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁Deadlocks are frequently caused by personality conflicts between the principal negotiators who let egos get in the way of a win/win agreement. It is sometimes necessary to change principal negotiators in order to get the negotiations back on track.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁A walkout or even the threat of a walkout may be used to your advantage, but not without risk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁When a walkout appears imminent, consider your best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA).</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25214" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-6-2.png" alt="" width="127" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consider questions such as:</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>•Is your position reasonable</li>
 	<li>•What is your BATNA?</li>
 	<li>•What is the contractor's BATNA?</li>
 	<li>•How can you make your position stronger?</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">⦁<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Return from a walkout</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Never walk out unless other alternatives appear more attractive</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Remain open to returning to the negotiation table</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Negotiation Success</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Factors that contribute to success in any negotiation always include:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•The specific circumstances surrounding each negotiation</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Skill of the negotiators</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Motivation and fairness of each party</p>

<strong>Successful Negotiations</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Negotiators should always keep in mind the following basic attitudes when negotiating contracts:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">•<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Think Win</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>The winning is the meeting of the objectives in the outcome of any negotiation</li>
 	<li>Avoid tactics that might be perceived as a win/lose style</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sell Your Position</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>Strive to be persuasive while being respectful and polite</li>

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">•Your goal is a mutually satisfactory outcome -find a way to make it happen</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Leadership Defined</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Leadership is <i><u>influencing </u></i>people by providing purpose, <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">direction,</span> </em>and <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">motivation</span> </em>while <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">operating</span> </em>to accomplish the mission and improving the organization.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Influencing</span> -getting people to do what you want them to do. It is the means or method to achieve two ends: operating and improving. There is more to influencing than passing orders along. The example you set is as important as your words you speak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Direction</span> -this gives people a reason to do things. You do not have to explain every decision to your subordinates' satisfaction. It does mean you must earn their trust. They must know that you as the leader would not ask them to do anything dangerous -unless there was a good reason, or it is an essential task to accomplish the mission.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Motivation</span> -this gives subordinates the will to do everything they can to accomplish a mission. It results in their own initiative when they see something needs to be done. To motivate your people, give them challenging missions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Operating</span> -actions taken to influence others serve to accomplish operating actions, those actions you take to achieve the short-term goal of accomplishing the mission.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Improving</span> -leaders also strive to improve everything entrusted to them: their people, facilities, equipment, training, and resources. There will always be a new mission, of course, but part of the old one is improving the organization.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Levels of Leadership</strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>-Three Levels -</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">NCOs like to make a decision right away and move on to the next thing…so the higher up the flagpole you go, the more important it is to learn a different style of leadership.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-25228" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-6-3.png" alt="" width="356" height="275" />

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DIRECT LEADERSHIP</span>-Direct leadership is face-to-face, first-line leadership. It takes place in those organizations where subordinates are used to seeing their leaders all the time: teams and squads, sections and platoons, companies, batteries and troops-even squadrons and battalions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP</span>-Organizational leaders influence several hundred to several thousand people. They do this indirectly, generally through more levels of subordinates than do direct leaders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP</span>-Strategic leaders include military and DA civilian leaders at the major command through Department of Defense levels. Strategic leaders are responsible for large organizations and influence several thousand to hundreds of thousands of people.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Loyalty is the big thing, the greatest battle asset of all. But no man ever wins the loyalty of troops by preaching loyalty. It is given to him as he proves his possession of the other virtues.</em></p>
-Brigadier General S.L.A Marshal

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Duty</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>Fulfill your Obligations</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The essence of duty is acting in the absence of orders or direction from others, based on an inner sense of what is morally and professionally right.</em></p>
-General John A. Wickam Jr.

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Respect</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>Treat people as they should be treated</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The discipline, which makes the soldiers of a free country reliable in battle, is not to be gained by harsh or tyrannical treatment. On the contrary, such treatment is far more likely to destroy than to make an army. It is possible to impart instruction and to give commands in such a manner and such a tone of voice to inspire in the soldier no feeling but an intense desire to obey, while the opposite manner and tone of voice cannot fail to excite strong resentment and a desire to disobey.</em></p>
-Major General John M. Schofield

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Selfless Service</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>Put the welfare of the nation, the army, and subordinates before your own.</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The nation today needs men who think in terms of service to their country and no in terms of their country’s debt to them.</em></p>
-General of the Army Omar N. Bradley

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Honor</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>Live up to all the army values</strong>

<em>What is life without honor? Degradation is worse than death.</em>

-Lieutenant General Thomas J, “Stonewall” Jackson

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Integrity</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>Do what’s right legally and morally</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The American people rightly look to their military leaders not to be skilled in the technical aspects of the profession of arms, but also to be men of integrity.</em></p>
-General J. Lawton Collins

&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Personal Courage</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>Face fear, danger, or adversity</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The concept of professional courage does not always mean being as tough as nails either. It also suggests a willingness to listen to the soldiers’ problems, to go to bat for them in a tough situation, and it means knowing just how far they can go. It also means being willing to tell the boss when he is wrong.</em></p>
-Former Sergeant Major of the Army William Connelly

<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 120%;"><strong>-Leaders Actions –</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>Influencing</strong>

•Communicating

•Decision Making

•Motivating

&nbsp;

<strong>Operating</strong>

•Planning and Preparing

•Executing

•Assessing

&nbsp;

<strong>Improving</strong>

•Developing

•Building

•Learning

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Communicating</strong> </span>-involves displaying good oral, written, and listening skills for individuals and groups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Decision Making</strong></span> -involves selecting the line of action intended to be followed as the one most favorable to the mission. This involves using sound judgment, reasoning logically, and managing resources wisely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Motivating</strong> </span>-involves inspiring and guiding others toward mission accomplishment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Planning and Preparing</strong></span> -involves developing detailed, executable plans that are feasible, acceptable, and suitable; arranging unit support for the exercise or operation, and conducting rehearsals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Executing</strong> </span>-involves meeting mission standards, taking care of people, and efficiently managing resources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Assessing</strong> </span>-involves evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of any system or plan in terms of its purpose and mission.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Developing</strong> </span>-involves investing adequate time and effort to develop individual subordinates as leaders. It includes mentoring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Building</strong> </span>-involves spending time and resources to improve teams, groups, and units and to foster an ethical climate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Learning</strong> </span>-involves seeking self-improvements and organizational growth. It includes envisioning, adapting, and leading change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Note</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The leadership actions influencing, operating, and improving are the same at all three levels of leadership.</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Human Dimensions</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<img class="size-full wp-image-25231 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-2-min-3.png" alt="" width="136" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Discipline</strong> </span>-this doesn’t just mean barking orders and demanding an instant response. You build discipline by training to standard, using rewards and punishment judiciously, instilling confidence in and building trust among the team members, and creating a knowledgeable collective will. The confidence, trust, and collective will of a disciplined, cohesive unit are crucial in combat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Morale</strong> </span>-is the most important intangible element of the human dimensions. It’s a measure of how people feel about themselves, their team, and their leaders. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">High morale comes from good leadership, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shared hardship, and mutual respect.</span> High morale results in a cohesive team that enthusiastically strives to achieve common goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Taking Care of Soldiers</strong></span> -creating a disciplined environment where they can learn to grow. It means holding them to high standards, training them to do so they function in peace and in war. You take care of soldiers when you treat them fairly, refuse to cut corners, share their hardships, and set the example.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Taking care of soldiers encompasses everything from making sure a soldier has time for an annual dental exam to visiting off-post housing to make sure it’s adequate. It also means providing the family support that assures soldiers and their families will be taken care of, whether the soldier is home or deployed.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Leadership Stress</strong></h2>
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 120%;"><strong>-Three Types of Stress –</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>Combat Stress</strong>
<ul>

 	<li>Stress in Training</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Stress of Change</strong>

<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Leadership Styles and</strong>
<strong>Consequences</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>Styles</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Directing</li>
 	<li>Participating</li>
 	<li>Delegating</li>
 	<li>Transformational</li>
 	<li>Transactional</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Consequences</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Intended</li>
 	<li>Unintended</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25233" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-1-min-7.png" alt="" width="400" height="200" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Directing</span>-leader centered. Leaders using this style do not solicit input from subordinates and give detailed instructions on how, when, and where they want a task performed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Participating</span>- centers on both the leader and the team. Given a mission, leaders ask subordinates for input, information, and recommendations but make the final decisions on what to do themselves. This style is especially appropriate for leaders who have the time for such consultation or who are dealing with experienced subordinates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Delegating</span> -involves giving subordinates the authority to solve problems and make decisions without clearing them through the leader. Leaders with mature and experienced subordinates or who want to create a learning experience for subordinates often need only to give them the authority to make decisions, the necessary resources, and a clear understanding of the mission’s purpose. As always, the leader is ultimately responsible for what does or does not happen, but in the delegating leadership style, the leader holds the subordinate leaders responsible for their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Transformational</span> -allows you to take advantage of the skills and knowledge of experienced subordinates who may have better ideas on how to accomplish a mission.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Transactional</span> -Motivating subordinates to work by offering rewards or threatening punishment. Prescribes task assignments in writing. Outlining all the conditions, the applicable rules and regulations, the benefits of success, and the consequences to include possible disciplinary actions of failure. “Management by exception,” where leaders focus on their subordinates’ failures showing up only when something goes wrong.</p>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="color: #2e86c1; text-align: center; font-family: open-sans; font-size: 28px;"><strong>Leadership Consequences –Two </strong><strong>Types</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intended Consequences</span>- are the anticipated results of a leader’s decisions and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unintended Consequences</span>- are the results of things a leader does that have an unplanned impact on the organization or accomplishment of the mission.</p>

<strong>Secrets of Great</strong>
<strong>Leaders</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Published on April 22, 2015</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Featured in: <strong>Leadership &amp; Management</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dr. Travis Bradberry</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Coauthor EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0 &amp; President at TalentSmart</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No one ever became a great leader without first becoming a great communicator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great leaders connect with people on an emotional level every time they speak. Their words inspire others to achieve more than they ever thought possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great communicators are intentional about it, and there are 10 secrets they rely on to deliver a powerful message. Put these secrets to work in your communication and watch your influence soar.</p>
&nbsp;

<strong style="color: #2e86c1;">1. They Know Their Audience</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great communicators don’t worry about sounding important, showing off their expertise, or boosting their own egos. Instead, they think about what people need to hear, and how they can deliver this message so that people will be able to hear it. This doesn’t mean that leaders tell people what they want to hear. Quite the opposite—they tell people what’s important for them to know, even if it’s bad news.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25236" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-4-min-6.png" alt="" width="179" height="250" />

&nbsp;

<strong style="color: #2e86c1;">2. They Are Experts in Body Language</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great communicators are constantly tracking people’s reactions to their messages. They are quick to pick up on cues like facial expressions and body language because they know this is the only feedback many people will give them. Great communicators use this expertise to tailor their message on the fly and adjust their communication style as needed.</p>
&nbsp;

<strong style="color: #2e86c1;">3. They Are Honest</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best leaders know that for communication to be effective it has to be real. They can’t have people parsing every word trying to separate fact from spin. When great communicators can’t share certain information, they come right out and say it because makeshift, half-truth answers breed distrust and anxiety. In good times and bad, honesty builds trust.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25237" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-min-10.png" alt="" width="192" height="250" />

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<strong style="color: #2e86c1;">4. They Are Authentic</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great communicators don’t try to be someone they’re not just because they’ve stepped behind a podium. There’s a reason Mark Zuckerberg presented Facebook to investors in a hoodie and jeans. Great leaders know that when they stay true to who they are, people gravitate to their message. They also know the opposite happens when leaders put on an act.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #2e86c1;">5. They Speak with Authority</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great communicators don’t try to cover their backs by being ambiguous, wishy-washy, or unassertive. Instead, they stick their necks out and speak very directly about how things are and how they need to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #2e86c1;">6. They Speak to Groups as Individuals</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leaders rarely have the luxury of speaking to one person at a time. Whether it’s a huddle around a conference table or an overflowing auditorium, great leaders know how to work the room and make every single person feel as if he or she is being spoken to directly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #2e86c1;">7. They Have Ears (And They Use Them)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great leaders know that communication is a two-way street and what they hear is often more important than what they say. When someone else is speaking, great communicators aren’t thinking ahead and planning what they’ll say next. Instead, they’re actively listening, fully focused on understanding the other person’s perspective.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25238" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-1-min-8.png" alt="" width="219" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #2e86c1;">8. They Use Phrases Like “It’s My Fault”, “I Was Wrong,” and “I’m Sorry”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When great leaders make a mistake, they admit it right away. They don’t wait for someone else to find and point out their blunder. They model accountability for their words and actions, even when they could have easily “gotten away” with the mistake. And they do it matter-of-factly, without drama or false humility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #2e86c1;">9. They Solicit Feedback</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best communicators never assume that the message people heard is the exact same one they intended to deliver. They check in to verify that their message was understood correctly, and, if it was not, they don’t blame the audience. Instead, they change things up and try again.</p>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25239" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blur_edges-2-min-4.png" alt="" width="187" height="250" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #2e86c1;">10. They’re Proactive</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leaders with the best communication skills don’t waste time playing catch-up. They’re quick to head off the rumor mill by sharing bad news in a timely manner. They also give clear, concise goals and directions so people don’t waste their time heading in the wrong direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bringing It All Together</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great communicators stand out from the crowd. They’re honest. They’re authentic. They listen. They excel in communication because they value it, and that’s the critical first step to becoming a great leader.</p>
